Learning how to use this stuff
My name is Andreas. I am trying to buikd the pre-requisite knowledge to take a data science and machine learning course on Udemy. I have one semester's expererience in python coding and nothing else, and this stuff doesn't come easily to me but I am eager to learn. I hope to apply what I learn to research, as I am currently studying to be a physician scientist. I am also greatly interested in intelligence and emergent phenomena, so to that end I hope to apply what I learn to the creation of interesting cellular automata based simulations.
